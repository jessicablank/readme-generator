## Description:  
 A command line interface that prompts the user for inputs to generate a markdown file intended to create a README.md project introduction on GitHub. This application was created as part of my coding bootcamp homework and I've updated it since creating the video featured in the YouTube Guide. I use this every time I need to update a Github README.
